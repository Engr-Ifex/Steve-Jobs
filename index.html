                <p>I will dearly miss Steve Jobs, he inspired me to keep getting the iphones. I have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man  and a awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day and go for and work with the apple when i get old but my dream is to own Apple and follow by Steve Jobs way and make Apple greater than before it was. But i will dearly miss Steve Jobs he's a great man and i will never forget him.    </p>
